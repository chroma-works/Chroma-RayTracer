## Introduction  
This repository is meant to contain a simple implementation of the ray tracing algorithm. Hopefully will surpass its humble conception. This page will also be used as a blog to update on the development process. Developed for CENG795 course at METU(2019-2020 Spring Semester).

## Build instructions for Windows  
### Requires:
* Visual Stuido(VS) 17+
* CMake 3.15.0+
### Instructions
After downloading and unzipping the repo open Cmake and fill the fields:  
**Where is the source:** unzipped/folders/directory/Chroma-RayTracer  
**Where to build binaries:** unzipped/folders/directory/Chroma-RayTracer/build  
then click configure where you will set your Visual studio version as the **"Generator for this project"*** and *x64* as **"Optional platform generator"**. Also select **"Use default native compilers"** option if it is not already selected.  
**Configure** then **Generate**.  
Then open the chroma-ray-tracer.sln file generated using VS located in the ./Chroma-RayTracer/build folder.  
Finally **Build** solution using VS.  

**Note:** After building the project, if it fails to run due to missing .exe file try setting the location of the .exe file by:  
Solution explorer -> chroma-ray-tracer -> (right click ->) properties -> General -> Output Directory -> 
* if Configuration: Debug -> unzipped/folders/directory/Chroma-RayTracer/bin/Debug  
* if Configuration: Release -> unzipped/folders/directory/Chroma-RayTracer/bin/Release

## Week 1
Although I have not made any advancements regarding "Ray-tracing" I have retrofitted my old classes from my old renderer[[1]](#1) to build a simple editor. This editor can;
* Load .obj files
* Render multiple lights of types:
  * Point lights
  * Directional lights
  * Spot lights
* Support textures
* Allow basic navigation/editing over the scene
* Uses Phong Shading  
Please keep in mind that footages given below are NOT ray traced in any shape or form. They are rendered using OpenGL3.

## Week 2
Asset importer for the scene files has been completed. It simply parses the xml file to construct the scene specified by it. Figure 3 displays the scene called "<a href="assets/scenes/simple.xml">simple.xml</a>"(Provided by course instructor) as rendered in the Raster based rendering pipeline(NOT ray traced).
