# Chroma Ray Tracer Development Blog  
### Author:Alper ≈ûahƒ±stan([STLKRv1](https://github.com/STLKRv1)) 

## Introduction  
This repository is meant to contain a simple implementation of the ray tracing algorithm. Hopefully will surpass its humble conception. This page will also be used as a blog to update on the development process. Developed for CENG795 course at METU(2019-2020 Spring Semester).

## Week 1
Although I have not made any advancements regarding "Ray-tracing" I have retrofitted my old classes from my old renderer[[1]](#1) to build a simple editor. This editor can;
* Load .obj files
* Render multiple lights of types:
  * Point lights
  * Directional lights
  * Spot lights
* Support textures
* Allow basic navigation/editing over the scene
* Uses Phong Shading  
Please keep in mind that footages given below are NOT ray traced in any shape or form. They are rendered using OpenGL3.

Although I have not implemented any sort of RayTracer(yet).I retrofitted my old renderer classes and combined them with a custom ImGui UI to create a simple editor. Here is the result.
